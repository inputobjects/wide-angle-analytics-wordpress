Easily add Wide Angle Analytics tracker script to your WordPress site. You can quickly configure your web analytics tracker script.

== Description ==
<a href="https://wideangle.co" target="_blank">Wide Angle Analytics</a> is a privacy-friendly, GDPR-compliant web analytics service. You can deploy it cookieless or with cookies enabled.

We promote remote configuration, meaning you configure the tracker behaviour directly from our service interface. However, to give you full control, some settings must be applied before initial communication with our service takes place.

We provide you with the ability to configure the tracker script with few settings, making sure that you are tracking your traffic effectively. At the same time, we give you tools to prevent leaking any or unintended Personal Data.

Our plugin offers you as easy to use configuration wizard. The plugin will automatically inject the necessary HTML to both Header and Footer to make the script record website visits.
